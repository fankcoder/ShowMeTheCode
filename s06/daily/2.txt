The Well-Earned Evening
There’s nothing better after a long day’s work than sitting on the sofa watching a movie or reading a book. Why not use this downtime to combine relaxation with something useful? Watch a foreign film in its original language with subtitles (you can even try to use the original language subtitles) so you can immediately see and review the words you’ve just heard. Pay attention to idioms and expressions typical of the language and use them in your own life the next chance you get. If you’re more of a book lover, avoid books that are too difficult or complicated at first. It’s been said that some of the greatest language talents start learning foreign languages with cartoons and children’s books – the proof of the pudding is in the eating!
